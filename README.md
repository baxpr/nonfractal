# nonfractal: MATLAB Toolbox for estimating nonfractal connectivity 

## Description 
It is a MATLAB toolbox for estimating nonfractal connectivity from a set of time series such as resting state fMRI BOLD signals.

## Depends 
* Statistics Toolbox
* wmtsa

## Getting Started
This toolbox was designed to work from MATLAB version 7.7 (R2008b) to the latest version with the Statistics toolbox. You can install this toolbox as follows.
1. Place all files of this toolbox at any directory, and add the directory to the MATLAB paths.
2. The wmtsa toolbox should be installed a priori. It can be downloaded from http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~wmtsa/ for free.
3. Try to run the demo script "bfn_demo_nonfractal".
